These are the exercises I am going to submit.

Error Propagation learned from Kai

This is the code for CIFAR10 :
  * v2_EP_CNN_CIFAR10.ipynb\
  EP outperforms MC-dropout by comparing ROC curve and AUC-CI.  

This is the code for GTSRB : 

  * v2_traffic_sign_EP_change_pooling.ipynb
  * v3_traffic_sign_EP_change_pooling.ipynb (deeper NN)\
  It seems that the combination of max pooling and MC-dropout has the best performance although in a deeper NN.
  
  * v2_traffic_sign_EP_change_dropout_rate_2.ipynb
  * v2_traffic_sign_EP_change_dropout_rate_3.ipynb
